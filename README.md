## What is bitloan?

Bitloan is an NFT collateralized lending marketplace where anyone can list their NFTs and stake their NFTs for P2P lending, access to short-term liquidity, and ease of funding issues.

## What is the main role of bitloan?

Users do not want to lose their NFTs, so they can mortgage their NFTs in this borrowing market to obtain short-term capital liquidity. The loan term is fixed and must be repaid within the due repayment period.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Pledge NFT certificates in Bitloan to obtain a certain amount of loans, so that the actual assets can be circulated and transferred in the form of NFT.

## What we learned

During the development process, we learned how to synergistically combine tokens and NFTs to achieve free exchange, obtain short-term flow of funds, and improve liquidity.



## Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
